# A vi clone in C++

hey! i wrote a simple clone of vi.
at first, i was rewriting [the kilo editor](http://antirez.com/news/108) by antirez in c++. i followed [this amazing tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/). 

i decided to branch off and try to implement the main vi features.

currently, normal, insert and command mode, reading and writing files as well as a basic search feature are working reasonably well.

contributions are always welcome!
